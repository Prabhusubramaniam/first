<b> Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen <a href="www.google.com" target="_blank">book</a>. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets <a href="www.google.com" target=blank> Lorem Ipsum</a> passages, and more recently with <a href="#">desktop</a> publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
